# Ficus

Ficus is aimed to be a fun way to give people awareness about air pollution and its issues.

This is a quick demo of the app: https://youtu.be/rIU2ETI-EC8

The app has a news section where users are be able to know interesting facts about air pollution and how we can reduce or prevent it. When the user reads the news/article they will able to accumulate points by taking a quiz about the same news/article they just read.

The users will see a profile page where they will be able how many points they have accumulated. In the future, the user will also be able to see how they have contributed to the improvement of air quality. These data will be collected everyday and it will be oriented on how the users avoided having to drive a gas car alone to get things done during the day (By walking, biking, busing, driving an alternative energy vehicle, car pooling, etc)

For people who need to drive, there's an interesting calculator in the app that will tell you how much money you can save and how much CO2 you can prevent from going to the air every year by switching to an EV.

### Next steps

- Gamify the News section
- Detect and/or allow ways the user is reducing their air pollution footprint
- Add a login and a dashboard to show the user how much pollution they have prevented and how many points they have acummulated by taking the mini-quizes.
