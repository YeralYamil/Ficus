# Ficus

Ficus is aimed to be a fun way to give people awareness about air pollution and its issues.

The app will have a news section where users will be able to know interesting facts about air pollution and how we can reduce or prevent it. When the user reads the news/article they will able to accumulate points by taking a quiz about the same news/article they just read.

The users will see a profile page where they will be able how many points they have accumulated. In the future, the user will also be able to see how they have contributed to the improvement of air quality. These data will be collected everyday and it will be oriented on how the users avoided having to drive a gas car alone to get things done during the day (By walking, biking, busing, driving an alternative energy vehicle, car pooling, etc)

For people who can't stop driving, there's an interesting calculator in the app that will tell you how much money you can save every year by switching to an EV.
